This website is going to be the first time I use mysqli and php to create a blog posting system. This will be the basics for the mvc website later. 
This website I will try deploying and when I upload it to github I will provide a link. 
I will be using the php blog website concepts and try recalling it. 
Though the php blog doesn't have a read more option. So I will use this video with javascript to make it hidden unless you click READ MORE video..................

I may also try including images. 
This and maybe another one will give me good enough practice to start pdo and then I will try making something with pdo then I will take the php course

This is going to be a website about Paris. 
What it will do is it will have a beautiful hero section where it shows the eifeal tower. It will then have a gallery of the photos of Paris. Then it will have a user experience section. Then it will have a service section to get a way to Paris.
